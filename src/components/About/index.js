              <br />
              I'm a local Texan that loves to upcycle thrifted clothing, embroider, and design.
              <br />
              <br/>
              I believe that anything can be made into a piece of art and my goal is to take things that have been used and discarded and make them beautiful again.

          I aim to spread love through my channeled creativity, and my inspiration comes from life itself and the urge to make the NOW a better experience while still honoring the trauma of the past.
